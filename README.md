# Pytorch implementations

This repository contains the implementations of different deep learning algorithms in pytorch. There are different sort of algorithms:

- Generative Adversarial networks (GANs)[https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/gan-whats-generative-adversarial-networks-and-its-application-f39ed278ef09]
- Object detection
- 3D classification

## GANs

Inside the GANs folder you will find the following implementations:

- DCGAN
- WGAN
- WGAN with gradient penalty
- Pix2Pix
- Cycle GAN

## Object detection

Inside the object detection folder you will find the following implementations:

- YOLO v1
- YOLO v3

## 3D classification

The algorithms contained in this folder can perform classification or segmentation tasks. Inside the 3D classification folder you will find the following implementations:

- Pointnet
- Pointnet++
